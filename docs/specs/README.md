# Serverless Harness — Milestone Registry

**This document is the source of truth for milestone numbering and status.** It supersedes the
milestone table in the parent research doc
([Zero-Trust, Multi-Agent Extensions](../../../docs/research/2026-06-18-zero-trust-multiagent-harness-extension.md) §5, "M7–M12"),
whose numbering collided with the built work and was partly reframed by the June-26
credential-plane re-examination.

## Why a registry

Two work streams accreted overlapping `M`-numbers:

- The **built** harness work ran `M1–M7`.
- The **design-only** zero-trust credential plane (parent research doc) _also_ started at `M7`, and
  later specs (`m10-mcp-code-mode`, `m13-…-egress`) reused/diverged from the parent's numbers.

Net effect: `M7` meant two different things, `M10` meant two different things (the parent's MCP
_gateway_ vs. the spec that _superseded_ it with code-mode), `M13` was self-labeled "provisional,"
and the June-26 harness specs had no number at all.

**Resolution:** freeze the built track as **Phase 1 (`M1–M7`)**; give the credential plane its own
**Phase 2 (`Z`-prefix)**. No spec files are renamed — dated, descriptive filenames stay, so existing
cross-references keep working. Pre-existing `M10`/`M13` labels are recorded here as **aliases**.

## Phase 1 — Decoupled Harness (BUILT, frozen)

The decoupled scale-to-zero pattern. These are done and referenced across commits, memory, and
`EXPERIMENTS.md`. **Frozen — do not renumber.**

## Leaf-Session Backend (BUILT)

The MVP leaf-session contract and the three pipeline archetypes it was tested against
([Pipeline Archetypes](2026-06-26-pipeline-archetypes-requirements.md)) — all shipped. These realize
the [Capability Charter](2026-06-26-leaf-session-backend-capability-charter.md) §5 MVP core and §8
promote-post-MVP (human-gate, cron trigger). They are the **MVP/charter track**, distinct from the
`M`-numbered built harness (Phase 1) and the `Z`-numbered credential plane (Phase 2).

All three archetypes (A parallel-fan-out, B human-gate, C scheduled) from the evidence base are now
built. Hardening hygiene across these is tracked in
[`2026-06-28-registry-hardening-hygiene-design.md`](2026-06-28-registry-hardening-hygiene-design.md).

## Two-tier Rearchitecture (`P`-prefix)

The [two-tier FS-free harness epic](https://github.com/kagenti/serverless-harness/issues/49): split
the fleet into an FS-free **harness** (agent brain — credentials, model loop, network I/O only) and a
durable **sandbox** (sole filesystem/syscall surface). Started as "run Archetype-A on OpenShift"; the
OCP RWX pain turned out to be a _symptom_ of harness filesystem I/O, not the problem. Distinct from
the `M`-numbered built harness (Phase 1) and the `Z`-numbered credential plane (Phase 2): this is an
**architecture** track, dependency-ordered `P1 → P2 → P0′ → P3`.

## SandboxTransport (`ST`-prefix)

Make the sandbox reachable from **anywhere** by inverting connectivity: the sandbox worker dials
_out_ over one gRPC bidi stream (HTTP/2 on `:443`), a single-replica in-cluster relay bridges it to
the harness, and both paths land behind the existing `SandboxTransport` seam
(`KubectlTransport` local + `GrpcRelayTransport` remote). Extends the shared-sandbox model (P2) to
untrusted bring-your-own / NAT / on-prem / other-cloud sandboxes without touching the Pi loop,
session backend, or leaf queue. Contract is a **language-neutral Protobuf IDL** (`sandbox/v1`), not
a TypeScript interface.

## Phase 2 — Zero-Trust Credential Plane (`Z`-prefix)

> **Roadmap anchor:** [Leaf-Session Backend Capability Charter](2026-06-26-leaf-session-backend-capability-charter.md) (evidence base: [Pipeline Archetypes & Requirements](2026-06-26-pipeline-archetypes-requirements.md)) tests the design against three independent agentic-pipeline archetypes and **reprioritizes** this track: the harness's core role is a **leaf-session backend for external orchestrators**. **Z1 (per-user identity) defers** until multi-tenant hosting; **Z6 _extras_ defer** — the core clean-context-subagent need (one archetype plans it) is met by a **re-entrant leaf-session contract**, not new machinery. Z3/Z5 stay "keep-light."
>
> **First buildable milestone:** [MVP Thin Slice — Leaf-Session Invocation Contract](2026-06-26-mvp-leaf-session-contract-design.md) (Archetype A) — proves an external orchestrator can dispatch N parallel, parameterized, run-to-completion leaf sessions with structured (volume-envelope) results, retry, and coverage audit, on scale-to-zero. Reuses M2–M6; defers the whole credential plane.

Principle (parent §2): _no component influenced by model output ever holds a raw secret._ Secrets
live only in identity-keyed egress points. Dependency-ordered:

### Dependencies (Phase 2)

- **Z1** underlies everything (SPIFFE identities enable Z3's mTLS and Z4/Z5's per-workload scope).
- **Z2 ⇄ Z3** are a pair: the harness lock-down's "secret-free harness" (Z2 H4) depends on the
  injector (Z3) holding the provider key; Z3's enforceable network boundary depends on Z2's
  default-deny egress.
- **Z5 builds on Z4** (the sandbox egress generalizes MCP code-mode's placeholder-swap).
- **Z2/Z3** are the **harness** side; **Z4/Z5** are the **sandbox** side. They share the spine (Z1)
  but are independent to build.
- **Z6** composes on the same plane (each subagent = own identity/sandbox). **Z7** validates Z1–Z6.

## Multi-User Service (`MU`-prefix)

Turning the harness from a single-tenant deployment into a **multi-user service**: an authenticated
API, sessions owned by the user who created them, and per-user credentials. Its own track rather than
a Phase-2 `Z` id, because Phase 2 is the **zero-trust credential plane** — a security architecture —
while this is a **product surface** with its own consumers and compatibility obligations. The two
meet at the credential: `MU` needs per-user credentials today, and Phase 2 is how they eventually
stop being held by anything model-influenced.

### Dependencies (MU)

- **MU1 composes with `P5`**, which is merged as a design
  ([ADR-0032](../adrs/0032-per-request-subject-no-ambient-credential.md)) with implementation on a
  separate contributor's track. P5 reserved `Authorization` for "may this caller use the harness" —
  which is exactly MU1 — and carries _whose work it is_ in `X-SH-Subject`. MU1 supplies the tier that
  makes that subject **trustworthy** rather than asserted. MU1 §3.5 records the split and what MU1
  does if P5's implementation has not landed.
- **MU1 diverges from Z1 §2** by holding identity and credentials in one tier
  ([ADR-0033](../adrs/0033-multi-user-control-plane.md)); **Z3/Z5 retire that divergence** as MU3.
- **MU2 is _not_ gated on [#237](https://github.com/rossoctl/serverless-harness/issues/237).** That
  issue governs the **workload-addressed** pool selector; MU2's partition uses the **envelope**
  selector, which prompt leaves already honour (`run-leaf.ts:124-128`, reached at `:390`). MU2's real
  work is that the `/turn` path resolves a single pod (`run-turn.ts:57`) rather than leasing from the
  pool — see MU1 §8.2.

## Rosso Cortex Integration (`RC`-prefix)

Reframes the Phase-2 credential plane around **Rosso Cortex / AuthBridge** as the concrete injection
**and** control mechanism, and around the `#89` SandboxTransport seam — for a single-tenant, Kind-first
PoC. AuthBridge sits on both harness HTTP egress hops as one "egress control-plane, two deployment
profiles" pattern: a **shared** LLM gateway and a **per-sandbox** egress forward-proxy. This
**supersedes the mechanism** of Z3 and implements a **static single-tenant slice** of Z5 (per-user /
RFC 8693 deferred). Distinct from the `Z`-numbered plane it reframes — this is an **integration** track,
so it takes its own prefix rather than a linear `Z` id.

## Lineage & supersessions (explicit)

- The parent research doc's **M7–M12** table is **superseded by this registry.** Its M-numbers are
  retained only as the "Alias" column.
- The parent's **MCP gateway (M10)** is **superseded** by **Z4** (MCP code-mode in the sandbox): MCP
  is code the model runs in the sandbox, not a harness-forwarded gateway call.
- The parent's **sandbox credential injection (M9)** is **subsumed** by **Z5** (generalized
  credentialed egress), of which MCP-over-HTTP is one interception case.
- The parent's **inference broker (M8)** is realized concretely as **Z3** (inference injector),
  and its sidecar placement is refined to a **separate pod** (Z2 H6 — NetworkPolicy granularity).
- The June-26 re-examination **reframed Z1's harness portion**: the harness gets a SPIFFE identity
  but **no egress waypoint** (its egress is fixed-destination; see Z2 §2.4).
- **RC1** (own `RC` track) reframes the plane around **AuthBridge (Rosso Cortex)** as the mechanism, plus the `#89`
  SandboxTransport seam. It **supersedes the _mechanism_ of Z3** (the plain Go injector becomes an
  AuthBridge shared gateway once control plugins share the hop) and **implements a static single-tenant
  slice of Z5** (per-user / RFC 8693 token-exchange deferred), unifying both under one "egress
  control-plane, two deployment profiles" pattern. Z3/Z5 are retained as the deployment-profile detail
  and the home of the deferred per-user work. Topology decision: [ADR-0025](../adrs/0025-authbridge-deployment-topology.md).

| **ADR**               | one significant decision + context + consequences      | committed, **permanent & immutable**, supersession-aware       | [`docs/adrs/`](../adrs/)                |
| **Plan** (impl steps) | _how, in what order_                                   | **local-only, ephemeral** — delete once coded; never committed | [`docs/plans/`](../plans/) (gitignored) |

- A **spec** is a dated deep-dive. It's never retro-edited — a superseded spec gets a
  `Status:` header pointing at its successor and stays in git as the point-in-time record.
- An **ADR** is the permanent spine: a short, immutable record of a single decision that links
  out to the spec for the full reasoning. See [`docs/adrs/README.md`](../adrs/README.md).
- A **plan** is a throwaway checklist, obsolete the moment the code merges — so plans are
  local-only work artifacts (gitignored). See [`docs/plans/README.md`](../plans/README.md).

### Status vocabulary (specs & ADRs)

Every spec and ADR carries a `Status:` line in its header, drawn from:

> `Proposed` → `Accepted` → `Implemented` → `Superseded by <link>` (or `Deprecated`)

When a design is replaced, set the old spec's status to `Superseded by <link to successor>`
rather than deleting it — the record of what we once thought, and why we changed, has value.
(For example, the removed Redis-transport remote-exec design is marked superseded by the
gRPC/Connect sandbox-transport spec, which records the supersession in its own §12.)

## Conventions going forward

- **New Phase-2 specs** take the next free **`Zx`** id and record it in this table.
- **Filenames stay dated + descriptive** (`YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`); the canonical `Zx` id
  lives here, not in the filename, to avoid rename churn.
- Each spec keeps the existing header block (Version / Status / Scope / Builds-on); cross-reference
  by **canonical id** (e.g. "Z3") with the filename in parentheses on first mention.
- Implementation plans live in [`docs/plans/`](../plans/) (local-only, gitignored), named for the
  spec they implement, and are deleted once the work is coded and merged.
