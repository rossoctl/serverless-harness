#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Bring up the P6 single-VM deployment: Redis, relay, sandbox containers, supervisor unit.
# Sibling of deploy/knative/setup-kind.sh and setup-ocp.sh (spec §4.4).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - a Linux VM with systemd and podman, Node 22+
#   - run as a user that can sudo to root (installs units under /etc/systemd/system)
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy/vm/setup-vm.sh
#
# Env overrides:
#   SH_UNIT_DIR       Where systemd unit files are installed (default /etc/systemd/system)
#   SH_ENV_DIR        Where the supervisor/relay env files live (default /etc/serverless-harness)
#   SH_INSTALL_DIR    Where the harness checkout lives on the VM (default /opt/serverless-harness)
#   SH_SANDBOX_COUNT     Number of sandbox containers to start (default 2)
#   SANDBOX_IMAGE        Sandbox container image (default ghcr.io/rossoctl/serverless-harness-sandbox:latest)
#   SH_SANDBOX_RELAY_ADDR  Address each sandbox container uses to dial the relay (default
#                          host.containers.internal:<SH_RELAY_PORT from relay.env>). Reaching
#                          the host from inside a container is the part of this script least
#                          verified on real hardware -- override this if the default does not
#                          resolve on your VM (see deploy/vm/README.md).
